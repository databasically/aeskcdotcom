         <p class="bio">Warren was raised in Sedan, Kansas the home of world famous clown Emmett Kelly (PS The worlds largest clown gathering parade is June 20,2010 in Sedan and is expected to be a Guinness world record).  He graduated from K-State with a hard earned BSME degree in ’71 (that’s the 1900s).  He traveled around the country with General Electric for 6 years, learning and selling prior to moving back to Kansas City.  Here he sold water source heat pumps for 5 years with American Air Filter before leaving to start West & Associates (HVAC rep firm) in ’82 and starve his family.  Twenty-Five years later, Warren sold his business and joined AES as a seasoned salesman. Now, he is just helping customers secure contracts that include our energy saving equipment (Warren says, “CALL ME”).  He is married (38 years) to Melissa with two adult children… Annie and Darren, and 3 grandchildren …Garrett, Lila, and Sally.  His interests include golf, K-State sports, boating &amp; fishing, church and mission trip.</p>
