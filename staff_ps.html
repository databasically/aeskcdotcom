         <h3>Pam Stephens</h3>
         Email: <a href="mailto:pstephens@aeskc.com">pstephens@aeskc.com</a><br/>
         PHONE: 913-894-4455 ext. 236<br/>

         <p class="bio">Pam was born in 19XX in the former “Sunshine State”; South Dakota which changed it’s motto to the “Mount Rushmore State”.
         <br/><br/>
         She is the oldest of 6 and was very active in high school (baton twirler, drum major, pep club, drama, went to State competitions a couple of times in what now days is called forensics; you know all that stuff). As a side note, her high school was built on the site of an old Nike missile base.
         <br/><br/>
         Her stint in college was with the mighty Plainsmen of Nebraska Wesleyan University.  She studied drama, acting, and elementary education figuring all of these would serve her well in life, and it looks like she was correct!
         <br/><br/>
         She moved to St. Louis and soon learned that city life is wonderful!  She met her wonderful and good looking husband (he’s standing over her shoulder…no doubt) while working in the commodities industry.  She likes to say, “He was my boss, but now after 30 years, I’m the boss!”
         <br/><br/>Pam and Gary have traveled and have been in almost all of the 50 states.  They have 3 children; 2 are graduating from college in 2010 and one is in high school.  They live for their kids enjoying all their activities from college and high school soccer games, track, drum-line, fraternity functions and yes, baby sitting a ferret for their son, our “grand-ferret.
         <br/><br/>Pam has been in this HVAC industry for 20 years, working with Warren West.  She started as a typist and his gal “Friday” and soon was selling equipment and handling many aspects of the office.  She joined AES with Warren as his project manager and the rest is new history.</p>
