         <p class="bio">Nancy is native to the Wichita area having grown up in Andover, Kansas. She attended Wichita State University and graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in 1994. After graduation, she went to work for a prominent mechanical contractor in Wichita, KS. But, she could not squelch her passion to see and live in other parts of the country. So she accepted a job with Westinghouse and moved to the East Coast. While working for Westinghouse, she completed the Naval Nuclear Training Program. After a few years away, she realized that she missed "home" and moved back to Wichita. She has been working for mechanical contractors and equipment sales firms in the Wichita area ever since. Nancy became a Registered Professional Engineer in 2001. If she's not helping her clients develop projects, she is probably drinking coffee or climbing a mountain with her husband, Jason, and her two step daughters.</p>
