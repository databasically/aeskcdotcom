         <ul class="bio">
         <li>Jeff was born the son of a poor man’s daughter in rural Joplin, MO one snowy night in December (12/29) of an undisclosed year sometime between 1971 and 1973….just in time to be a tax write-off for Mom and Dad!</li>
         <li>He was raised on a small farm in the rural little town of Oak Grove east of Kansas City.  Actually, the “farm” was more like a plot in the middle of a subdivision, but there was a dog and a couple of hamsters, so it felt sort of “farm-ish”.</li>
         <li>Jeff spent most of his childhood enveloped in obscurity until finding himself in the limelight for the first time as Valedictorian of his senior class at Oak Grove High School in 1991.</li>
         <li>Shortly after this scholastic accomplishment, Jeff was humbled by his first semester mid-term grade card at the engineering school he was attending.</li>
         <li>Jeff overcame his early academic adversity and graduated cum laude from the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1996 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering.  This resulted in a very nifty certificate to display.</li>
         <li>Jeff began his career in May of 1996 as a junior mechanical engineer at a Kansas City engineering consulting firm where he learned design techniques for pharmaceutical and biotech facilities.  Despite the apparent prestige of his new position, he was humbled yet again by earning the nickname “Fuzz-Winky” from one of the company’s leaders.</li>
         <li>Jeff embarked on a new adventure in his career by joining a prominent Kansas City architectural/engineering firm in May of 2000 where he learned a new facet of engineering in sports venue design.  He was also upgraded to a more prestigious nickname of “Scooter”.</li>
         <li>In 2001, Jeff earned his Professional Engineer’s license in the State of Missouri. He really liked the new title he could use on his business cards, and the little rubber stamp made him feel really special….very un-Scooterish and definitely un-Fuzz-Winkyish.</li>
         <li>Changes in the market led Jeff to yet another prestigious firm in March of 2004 where he was able to help grow and develop a sports design group within the company.</li>
         <li>Jeff earned his LEED accreditation in November of 2007.  Another new title was added to his business card, and another nifty certificate was hung on his wall.</li>
         <li>Throughout Jeff’s engineering career, he served as Chair of several committees and as a member of the Board of Governors in the Kansas City Chapter of ASHRAE.  In 2008, Jeff became President of the KC ASHRAE Chapter and was dubbed “King ASHRAE” by an anonymous and yet undisclosed member.  Some say the title was self-administered, but Jeff emphatically denies it (sort of).</li>
         <li>In November of 2008, Jeff decided to pursue another career avenue and joined Associated Equipment Sales (AES).  Jeff currently works as a Sales Engineer for AES and is completing his term on the KC Chapter of ASHRAE Board of Governors as Past President (a.k.a. Ex-King).  Oddly enough, Jeff has found himself to be strangely void of any derogatory or childish nicknames as of late.  He’s coming to think of himself as “Just Jeff”.  Perhaps that will change.</li>
